# CT-Property-Trends
This project was created for CIS 4301 (Information and Database Management Systems I) at UF Online
# Description
The CT Property Trends application allows users to gain deeper insight on real estate trends in Connecticut over the past 15 years by exploring detailed property sales data from within the state. 

# Purpose 
* Assist homeowners and sellers on determining the best time to sell their home is and what price according to market value is fair when making an offer to buy a house
* Assist realtors in being able to  analyze past sales amount trends to determine the best value to price a home that would attract buyers and also sell for a reasonable amount
* Assist investors in making  better informed decisions about where to buy and sell properties for investment purposes by analyzing the historical trends in property value and sales volume based on location
* Assist appraisers in determining accurate home valuations that reflect the current market prices by analyzing past real estate market trends

# How It Works
Users can specify the information theyâ€™re looking for by filtering by town, specific year and month (or a range of years), sales amounts, sales ratios, and different property types from a submission form

Then, users will visualize the data through two primary graphical representations: an interactive map and a comprehensive trend graph

# Project Startup Instructions
First, clone the repository
cd ./CT-Property-Trends

## Frontend
1. cd ./client
2. npm install --legacy-peer-deps
3. npm start 
- The frontend runs on localhost:3000 by default
- --legacy-peer-deps is added to fix the upstream dependency conflict

## Backend
1. cd ./server 
2. npm install
3. npx nodemon index.js
- The backend runs on port 2000 by default

## Database
The database used for this project is Oracle
- A UF VPN must be connected for database use

### Dataset
The dataset used for the project was sourced from the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, which maintains a comprehensive listing of real estate sales across the state

This dataset encompasses all real estate transactions with a sales price of $2,000 or greater between October 1st and September 30th annually, spanning from 2007 to 2022 grand list year

Dataset fields include:
* List Year: Indicates the grand list year of the sale
* Date Recorded: The exact date when the sale was recorded
* Town: The municipality where the property is located
* Property Address: The specific address of the sold property
* Assessed Value: The value assigned to the property for taxation purposes
* Sale Amount: The actual sale price of the property
* Sales Ratio: A ratio indicating the relationship between the assessed value and the sale amount
* Property Type: Categorizes properties as residential, condo, commercial, or vacant land
* Residential Type: Provides additional detail on the type of residential property
* Non Use Code: Non usable sale code typically means the sale price is not reliable for use in the determination of a property value
* Assessor Remarks: Remarks from the assessor
* OPM remarks: Remarks from OPM
* Location: Latitude/longitude coordinates

All insertion commands for each table can be found in the database directory
